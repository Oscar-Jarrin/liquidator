I tool I implemented to know what I did in the month helping my parents

For some time, I have my parents in their business, and they would pay me some money per "polished embroidery".
So I had to write on a book every **name of the embroidery**: ammount I polished and at the end of every month, manually sum it all up by hand.
So I implemented this, a C program that from a file with
embroidery name: units polished list in a file (in a predefined folder), and given a unit price, can calculate what I had made in that month with less effort.
